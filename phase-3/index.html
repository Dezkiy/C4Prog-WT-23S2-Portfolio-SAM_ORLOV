            <h3>DOESN'T IT JUST WORK?</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/mouse.avif" alt="computer mouse">
            <p> Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has ways of
                acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the point where it has
                become a pastime consuming most of his leisure time. He now has streams of
                people seeking repairs, advice and assistance.</p>
            <p> "Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when they came
                to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.</p>
            <p> I said I could and asked what they needed."</p>
            <p> The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and, since it
                was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or instructions.</p>
            <p> "I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!'</p>
            <p> She hadn't, of course."</p>

            <h3>MAKE MY DAY, PC</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/pc.avif" alt="desktop computer">
            <p> Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes his story
                proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
                working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
                was a local police officer.</p>
            <p> "He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
                tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
                his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.</p>
            <p> Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
                took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
                gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too.</p>
            <p> It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early!"</p>
            <p> This is the first we've heard of someone trying to fix a computer by intimidating it.</p>

            <h3>THE BLUE SCREEN SHOWDOWN</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/blue-screen.avif" alt="blue screen of death">
            <p> Sarah Nolan, a junior IT tech from Perth, recalls her first week on the job at a mining company. 
                One of the field engineers stormed into her office, slamming down his ruggedized laptop 
                that had been hit with the dreaded Blue Screen of Death.</p>
            <p> “Without saying a word, he reached into his bag and pulled out a massive hunting pistol, 
                placed it gently on the desk, and said, ‘If this thing bluescreens again, it’s going out with a bang.’
                I just ran a memory test, swapped the RAM, and handed it back. Problem solved. 
                He nodded, holstered the gun, and walked away like nothing happened.”</p>
            <p> Welcome to IT support, where every day feels like a Wild West showdown.</p>

            <h3>THE UNDEFINED SHOWDOWN</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/code.avif" alt="code">
            <p> Alex, a junior developer from Melbourne, once sat in on a late-night
                debugging session with a very frustrated senior.</p>
            <p> He kept muttering, ‘Why won’t this work?!’ Every time he ran the code, 
                the browser console just printed:
                undefined</p>
            <p> After two hours of swearing at the screen, he stood up, pointed at the monitor 
                like Clint Eastwood, and shouted:
                ‘Define yourself, you coward!’</p>
            <p>Turned out he forgot to write a return statement.”</p>
