                David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                statement that it was all their original work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
            </p>
            <p>
                End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
                and pasting to cover assignment work.

            <h3>That's My Lecture</h3>
            <p>
                Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject.
                But IT lecturers are a funny lot.

                Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school...

            <p>
                "What is that?" she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                present a talk on internet security."

                Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
